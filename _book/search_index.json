It utilizes a systems approach, or systems science, which studies interacting and dynamic sets of subsystems. Systems thinking helps us understand large and complicated problems that might be difficult to grasp (i.e. global weather patterns) by breaking it down into smaller systems easier to grasp (i.e. air movement patterns). Earth system science seeks an understanding of how all of Earths sub-systems coexist and affect each other under changing conditions. It was facilitated by the advent of remote sensing technologies and GIS, that allowed us to make continuous observations of Earth at a grand scale. 1.2 Systems A system is any portion of the universe that can be isolated from the rest of the universe for the purpose of observing and measuring changes. They represent coupled components that change over time. For example, a bike is a system that is made up of components like wheels, gears, and chains. When you couple the components with each other, the bike works. The components (think wheels, gears, chains) are also known as reservoirs, state variables, or stocks. The couplings (what links them together) are also known as flows or links. 1.3 System Representations Systems are composed of state variables. The system state is the value of the state variables in a system at a single point in time. 1.3.1 Box Models A box model is a simple graphical representation of a system that commonly depicts the storage and movement of materials and energy across interacting systems. They can be used to show essential quantitative features of a system such as the process and rate by which matter/energy enters and leaves, the process and rate by which matter/energy moves internally within various parts of the system, and the amount of matter/energy at a given time and its distribution across the parts of the system. A box model often depicts the flow, or movement, of matter/energy from one system to another. A quantitative box model would likely depict the flux, which is the actual amount and rate of matter/energy being transferred. The boxes of a box model represent reservoirs, which indicate a place where matter/energy are stored for a period of time within the system. Steady state is when the flux of matter/energy into a reservoir matches the flux out of that reservoir. A sink is when the flux of something into a reservoir is greater than the flux of that thing out of the reservoir. A source is when the flux out of the reservoir is greater than the flux into it. Residence time is the average amount of time some substance spends in a particular reservoir. 1.3.2 Mathematical Models System dynamics is the change in the system over time. Mathematically speaking, change = , the system = X, and time = t. Therefore X/t (the derivative) is just the change in the system over the change in time. X/t (system dynamics) are determined by the flows. Flows can be written as Flowin + Flowout Flow ins are usually positive, flow outs are negative. Therefore, X/t = Flowin + Flowout The partial derivative, () is used to describe one portion of the system, such as the change in state variable x or state variable y. The partial changes add up to a whole change. Changes can be discrete (): happens at a specific point in time (MESM students incoming and outgoing happens at discrete time points) continuous (d): changes are ongoing (people entering and leaving a zoom call happens continuously). Continuous changes are usually demonstrated by a rate. In ESS, we are almost always dealing with continuous variables, because things are always changing. 1.4 Types of Systems Systems are defined by their boundaries. We want to consider whether energy or mass can cross that boundary. An open system allows flow of energy and mass. A closed system allows flow of energy but not mass An isolated system does not permit a flow of mass nor energy across its boundaries. The Earth System itself is a (mostly) closed system, allowing energy in the form of solar radiation in, but no mass (apart from meteorites and traces of hydrogen atoms). The implications of this are significant because the amount of matter in a closed system is fixed and finite, and when changes are made in one part of a closed system, the results eventually affect the other parts of the system. 1.5 Flows vs Fluxes Flow - a quantity over time Flux - a quantity over time per unit of area 1.6 Extensive vs Intensive Variables Extensive Measures  properties that depend on the size or extent of a system. If you have a larger system it will inherently have larger properties that make up that system. Intensive Measures  properties that do not depend on the size or extent of a system. This is a much more value measurement for comparing and understanding systems). While it may not be immediately obvious, intensive variables tell us much more about the system than extensive variables. 1.7 Residence Time Residence Time or Turnover Time is the average amount of time that a quantity stays in a reservoir, when the reservoir is in steady state. Calculating turnover time/residence time is very important for describing the speed/rate at which systems dynamics occur. Generally calculating turnover time/residence time only applies to systems that are in steady state. If the system is in steady state, then you divide the total amount in the reservoir by the total flux in or flux out (they would be equal) to get the residence time. In the above model, we can deduce the residence time for warm surface ocean = 34m3/1.2m3 per year = 28.3333 years 1.8 System Stability 1.8.1 Steady State Steady state is when the flux in equals the flux out, and therefore there is no change in value of the state variable. 1.8.2 Equilibrium A system in balance is said to be in equilibrium. Unstable Equilibrium gets further away from from the original state Dynamic Equilibrium stays nearby the new state Stable Equilibrium returns to the original state 1.8.3 Stable vs Unstable Systems Stable Systems - always attracting back to where the system started Unstable - system is brittle, which leads to exponential growth Exponential Growth is an example of unstable. This only has one steady state and that is when the population is at zero. However, at zero the system is unstable because if we have any population growth or perturbation the system will grow exponentially. Logistic Growth represents stable and unstable. For a system that has a carrying capacity, there are two state of equilibrium. The first is when the population is at zero and there is no growth rate (this is similar to above when there is an equilibrium at zero for exponential growth). However, when the system reaches its carrying capacity, it reaches another state of equilibrium because N=population size starts to equal K=carrying capacity. In looking at the equation below, when N and K are equal to each other you get N/K = 1, then this is subtracted from 1 to get zero, so then dN/dt = 0, which means that the system is stable/not changing = equilibrium. The graphic below shows that when we have a population that is greater than carrying capacity, it creates a negative (1-N/K) which leads to a decline in the rate of population change (rN). Inversely, if you have a population size that is less than carrying capacity, the rate of change increases. 1.9 Feedback Loops A feedback is a system response that occurs when the output of the system also serves as an input and leads to changes in the system state. A negative feedback is when the systems response is in the opposite direction of the initial input. Negative Feedback cycles are stabilizing and usually contribute to a systems equilibrium, or balance. For example, a heating system in a house recognizes an initial change of the room cooling down, and responds by initiating the furnace to heat the room to its original temperature. A positive feedback is when the system responds in to a change in the same direction as the initial disruption. An increase in output leads to an even further increase in output. Fore example, a fire starting in a forest: the fire starts, and dries out the wood nearby, which then becomes prone to catching fire itself, and the vicious cycle continues leading to a larger and larger fire.

This section reviews the properties of energy, as well as the relationship of different properties and their effects on Earths energy balance. Here is quick reference to the various factors of the energy balance equation: 2.2 Forms of Energy Transfer Radiation: energy that travels in the form of waves or particles and is part of our everyday environment. People are exposed to radiation from cosmic rays, as well as to radioactive materials found in the soil, water, food, air and also inside the body. Conduction: the process by which heat or electricity is directly transmitted through a substance when there is a difference of temperature or of electrical potential between adjoining regions, without movement of the material. Convection: the movement caused within a fluid by the tendency of hotter and therefore less dense material to rise, and colder, denser material to sink under the influence of gravity, which consequently results in transfer of heat. Evaporation: the process of turning from liquid into vapor. 2.3 Shortwave and Longwave Radiation Short wave = high energy radiation Long wave = low energy radiation Higher the temperature, the higher the emittance Sun - emits shortwave Earth - emits longwave Space - none really 2.4 Radiative Absorption, Reflection, and Transmission Absorption: taking in radiation Reflection: sending back radiation Transmission: exchanging radiation 2.5 Albedo Albedo (meaning whiteness) is a measure of reflectivity of visible light. It is measured on a scale from 0 (corresponding to a blackbody) to 1 (completely white/reflective).White objects reflect all wavelengths of light, therefore they have a high albedo. 2.6 Emissivity Emissivity is the efficiency at which electromagnetic energy is emitted. Or the measure of an objects ability to emit infrared energy. Emitted energy indicates the temperature of the object. Emissivity can have a value from 0 (shiny mirror) to 1.0 (blackbody). Most organic, painted, or oxidized surfaces have emissivity values close to 0.95. 2.7 Relationship of Radiative Energy and Temperature All objects emit radiation if their temperature is greater than absolute zero (zero degrees Kelvin). There is an inverse relationship between wave length and frequency (small wavelength, high frequency). There is a direct relationship between radiative energy and temperature. Radiation is proportional to temperature. The sun emits energy that is within the light spectrum that we can see with human eyes. Black Body - an idealized opaque, non-reflective body. Perfect emitter, emissivity = 1. It emits ALL possible energy given its temperature. 2.7.1 Stefan-Boltzmann Law the total energy radiated per unit surface area of a black body across all wavelengths per unit time j (also known as the black-body radiant emittance) is directly proportional to the fourth power of the black bodys thermodynamic temperature T: 2.7.2 Weins Displacement Law The black-body radiation curve for different temperatures will peak at different wavelengths that are inversely proportional to the temperature. As the temperature increases, the overall radiated energy increases, we see shorter wavelengths 2.8 Sensible Heat The energy you can feel. The energy required to change the temperature of a substance with no phase change. The temperature change can come from the absorption of sunlight by the soil or the air itself. Or it can come from contact with the warmer air caused by release of latent heat (by direct conduction). If the surface temperature is greater than the air temperature, sensible heat will flow from the ground to the atmosphere. The inverse also happens. 2.9 Latent Heat The heat required to convert a solid into a liquid or vapor, or a liquid into a vapor, without change of temperature. Both latent heat flux and sinsible heat flux are dependent on gradients and resistances: 2.10 Ground Heat Flux The heat transferred along the temperature gradient through materials directly in contact with each other (in this case the ground). It is the loss of energy by heat conduction through the lower boundary. It is a positive number when it is directed away from the surface into the ground 2.11 Conductance vs Resistance For any convective flux, the gradients and the resistances determine the magnitude of these fluxes.

RISE when heated, expands and becomes less dense than the air around it LOWERs when it cools, becomes more dense than the air around it Ideal gas law: pressure inversely proportional to volume Temperature and volume are proportional 3.3 Coriolis Effect The Coriolis Effect is an effect whereby a mass moving in a rotating system experiences a force (the Coriolis force) acting perpendicular to the direction of motion and to the axis of rotation. On the earth, the effect tends to deflect moving objects to the right in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern and is important in the formation of cyclonic weather systems. It is a force that arises from the Earths curvature and rotation. RULE OF THUMB: Coriolis force acts to the RIGHT of motion in the Northern Hemisphere, to the LEFT if in the Southern Hemisphere. Vanishes at the equator. Two mechanisms drive the Coriolis effect: * Conservation of angular momentum * Centripetal acceleration Explanation - the earth is rotating. Every spot on the earth travels 360 degrees over the course of the day. However, depending on where you are in latitudes, you would travel a longer distance if you are at the equator vs the axis of rotation. Regardless you have the same angular momentum - if you move south, then the earth underneath you moves faster, so you are defected to the west. Even if you are moving directly along a line of latitude (i.e. moving directly east or west) you are still deflected by the Coriolis effect. The only way to avoid Coriolis effect is if you are traveling directly along the equator, or are firmly attached to the surface. 3.4 Hadley Circulation The Hadley cell, named after George Hadley, is a global scale tropical atmospheric circulation that features air rising near the Equator, flowing poleward at a height of 10 to 15 kilometers above the earths surface, descending in the subtropics, and then returning equatorward near the surface. It occurs because Warm air rises at the equator and cools and then diverges north and south. As air cools, it sinks again and converges back at the equator. 3.5 Geostrophic Balance &amp; Geostriphic Wind Geostrophic Wind/Flow: The theoretical wind that would result from an exact balance between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force (PGF). This condition is called geostrophic balance. The geostrophic wind is directed parallel to contour lines (lines of constant pressure at a given height). This balance seldom holds exactly in nature. The true wind almost always differs from the geostrophic wind due to other forces such as friction from the ground. Despite this, much of the atmosphere outside the tropics is close to geostrophic flow much of the time and it is a valuable first approximation. Pressure gradients are perpendicular to local pressure contour lines. Like all gradients, the direction fo the gradient goes from high to low. This effect results in different wind patterns around high and low pressure zones. 3.6 Hydrostatic Balance In fluid mechanics, hydrostatic equilibrium or hydrostatic balance is the condition of a fluid (fluid can be air or water) at rest. This occurs when external forces such as gravity are balanced by a pressure-gradient force. 3.7 Geopotential Height Geopotential height is the work that must be done against Earth gravitational field to raise a 1kg mass from sea level to a height of z. Geopotential height maps (usually in meters) are always associated with pressure, and is closely related to temperature; cooler air parcels are smaller/denser and easier to reach the top; warmer parcels are taller because theyre less dense and there is further to reach the top to reach a certain pressure Depending on the temperature of the air, will require you to go to a higher height / geopotential height to get to a certain pressure. I.e. if you want to get to a pressure of 500 millibars, then as you go up in the atmosphere, you have to go to different heights to get to that pressure for cold air vs warm air. 3.8 Adiabatic Lapse Rates Adiabatic lapse rates look at the change in temperature through the change in height (z). An Adiabatic process is one where no energy exchange is happening between the environment and an isolated air parcel. When air moves this way you can change the volume, temperature and pressure The amount of energy/heat coming into an air parcel results in the air parcel to either do work (to get rid of the heat) or internalize the heat (change the amount of internal energy in the air parcel). Adiabatic Lapse Rates differ depending on atmospheric conditions  if the air is undersaturated then you follow the dry adiabatic lapse rate. But when you reach the lifting condensation level, the moisture condenses and you follow the moist adiabatic lapse rate. The moist adiabatic lapse rate will always be lower than the dry adiabatic lapse rate. 3.8.1 Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate When an air parcel does not contain any moisture, we use Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate - If you raise the air parcel adiabatically, then using the gas law, your volume is going to be larger and temperature is going to be smaller. This explains why when you go to the top of a mountain, it is colder and there is less air. However, air doesnt follow the dry conditions perfectly because there is always moisture in the air. 3.8.2 Moist Adiabatic Lapse Rate A parcel of air containing water vapor rises, expands, cools and eventually the water condenses. Then latent heat is released into the air parcel and it warms up slightly. So all of the same processes of the adiabatic process are happening but energy is released into the air parcel, so atmospheric moisture makes temperature decrease more slowly with height. Moist adiabatic lapse rate depends on amount of water present. This makes the lapse rate less negative / temperature decreases more slowly with height than it would with no moisture there, because some of heat you lose is added back through the release of latent energy when moisture condenses. Values can vary typically between 4 and 8 C/km, but generally we will use the following formula: 3.9 Vapor Pressure &amp; Saturation Vapor Pressure Vapor Pressure is the pressure of vapor above a liquid surface. Saturation Vapor Pressure is the pressure of vapor above a liquid surface (usually water  but true for any liquid) when it is at equilibrium with its surroundings. It varies strongly with pressure, as seen in the saturation vapor pressure curve. The higher temperatures mean higher saturation vapor pressure  this helps us determine where clouds will form. 3.10 Lifting Condensation Level Lifting condensation level is the level, or height, that you need to lift a parcel to in order for condensation to happen. 3.11 Static Stability Defined as the stability of the atmosphere in hydrostatic equilibrium with respect to vertical displacements.  The stability of the parcel is dependent upon the parcels motion after a forced displacement from an original location. If your lapse rate is lower than the dry adiabatic lapse rate then your atmosphere is stable; if you change height on blue line, you dont change temperature as quickly. Stable: Unstable: Rules of Thumb for Static Stability * Local lapse rate exceeds the adiabatic lapse rate, the atmosphere is unstable. * Inversions happen in stable atmospheres. * The type of clouds youre likely to see depend on the local atmospheric stability. 3.12 Inversions Sometimes air doesnt cool as you get higher in the atmosphere. And this is what happens with an inversion. Important implications for air quality. Causes a layer of smog to sit above a city. 3.12.1 Subsidence Inversion Subsidence Inversion: air warmed by compression, from high deserts, flows to lower elevations gaining in pressure and temperature (adiabatic) and sits on top of the inversion base (cooler air). Ex: LA smog is often caused by this and the marine inversion 3.12.2 Marine Inversion Marine: in coastal areas; cool marine air is brought to land by prevailing winds. It is cool and dense so sinks low, and warmer air from land flows above it. Examples: marine layer in the morning, June gloom 3.12.3 High Pressure Inversion High Pressure: caused by a high pressure system aloft, air diverges and spreads at inversion base 3.13 Fronts A front is a time when there is a strong gradient of temperatures and masses of air coming together. Cold front is the denser mass of air goes underneath the less dense warmer air. Oppositely, there can be a warm front where the warm front that goes up above the cold air. The difference in fronts is just what way the air is moving. Cold: mass of cold air hitting a mass of warmer air ; cold air is denser, advances and replaces warm air Warm: Warm air replaces cool air "]]
